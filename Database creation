I created my database MOVIES.db in SQLite prompt as @sqlite3 MOVIES.db when entered a database is created in the given path or provided path , on that database all the DML and DDL operations are done. Database creation can be done from the sqlite prompt or from the SQLiteStudio tool which is a GUI used for easy accessing of the databases with its tables . The operations done on the databases is seen using the SQLiteStudio tool and SQLite prompt.
