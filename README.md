# MuleSoft-Assesment 

This assesment was very helpful and informative for me , learned lot of things related to databases and the driver with their respective java coding. In this assesment i went with using SQLite software library or RDBMS and connected to the database with the help of JDBC drivers and performed DDL and DML operations on the respective database.


Task assigned - 

step-1
Connect to the SQLite database (or any Database you know): Learn how to download SQLiteJDBC driver and connect to an existing SQLite database using JDBC.

step-2
Creating a new SQLite database – Learn how to create a new SQLite database from a Java (any language) program using SQLiteJDBC driver or related driver.

step-3
Creating a new table (Movies) using JDBC / Other Languages – before working with data, you need to create a table called Movies. Learn how to create a new table in an SQLite database from a Java (any language) program.

step-4
Inserting data into Movies table from a Java (any language) program

step-5
Querying data from Movies table with or without parameters – after having the movies data in the table, you need to query the movie details (name, actor, actress, director, year of release) using a SELECT statement. You will need to write a program to issue a simple SELECT statement to query all rows from the Movies table, as well as use a query with parameter like actor name to select movies based on the actor's name.

All the code files are provided in the repository.
